# Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for businesses across various industries. Predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and maintain revenue. This project utilizes a dataset containing customer information and churn labels to train an ANN model, which can then predict the probability of churn for new customers.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [XYZ source] and contains a variety of features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history. Additionally, the dataset includes a binary label indicating whether each customer has churned or not. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers, ensuring the quality of input data for training the ANN model.
